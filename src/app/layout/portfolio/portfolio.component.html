                This site is a Single Page Application (SPA) which means it makes no round trip to the server when you click a menu item. It is highly efficient especially in slow internet connections. It is written in Angular 4, Bootstrap, jquery, in Typescript along
                with plain old javascript. The Web server is Nodejs and Express as part of the MEAN stack. Some things to try: * Click rapidly between the pages * click the Switch sides button choose the menu item that matches the skills you need on your
                project. This does not take the place of my resume or interview. Select Contact me menu for contact information. </td>
